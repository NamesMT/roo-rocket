## Overview & Features

**`roo-rocket`** is a toolkit/engine (and a community webpage coming soon!) that helps you create or install configurable `config pack`s, specfically targeting [**`Roo Code`**](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code).

In simple words, **`Roo Rocket`** help you install/create `Roo Code` configurations, which can have these features:
  + üî´ (Dangerously) optimized `Footgun` prompts (system prompt overrides)
  + üìë Memory Banks
  + üê±ü¶ÅüêØüêª Smart / Custom Modes
  + üìöüïπÔ∏èüîé MCPs!
  + *And endlessly more!* üöÄ

### `RR` for users:
  + **Cross-platform** ü™üüçèüêß
  + **Easy, interactive, safe install** of any any zip archive / `troop` (config pack) (dictionary: collective of kangaroos), whether its a public one shared by your friend, or your own, privately-stored.
    + `roo-rocket` does not allow any code execution, so the installation of a config pack is safe, but you should verify that the archive contains the files that you expect.  
    *(Tip: you can ask `Roo` to help analyze the installed instruction files and check if there is anything unusual)*

### `RR` for creators (trainers):
  + **Config type-safety**: powered by `Typescript (TS)`, providing type-safety, autocompletion, and typedoc documentation right in your IDE while crafting your `troop`s.
  + **Powerful creator candies**:
    + `parameters` that works interactively with your users.
    + `variables`, `excludes`, `filesBuilder` helps you conditionally customize your assemble process without code execution.
    + `fuel` context support that help you reduces duplication work in multiple files.
    + `frame` template for the quick file-to-file base bones.
    + `snapshot` that helps simulating of an existing user project, ensuring your configs will deploy correctly. (Intended for more advanced use case like testing AI agents) (TBA)
  + **Easy shipping**: Bundle your `troop`, or just create a zip archive, add it to a GitHub release, or upload it somewhere, and everyone can use it via `roo-rocket` CLI!

## Rationale

The strength of **`Roo Code`** lies in its customization power, and there's no centralized community and toolkit yet, so, let's build one!

## Usage

### For users

```sh
npx roo-rocket --repo="NamesMT/config-packs"
# Or by url: `npx roo-rocket --url=https://direct.url/to-arhive.zip`

# Interactively configure the installation parameters (if any)
# Nothing more, enjoy :)
```

### For creators (trainers)

* There are two ways to start:
  * For the full experience:
    * Generate a repo from [`config-packs-template`](https://github.com/NamesMT/config-packs-template)
      * > It's a template to create your own `config pack`s for `config-rocket` ecosystem.
    * Check `roo-rocket` rules here: [libs/roo-rocket](./libs/roo-rocket/README.md)
  * For a simple, fast start:
    * Just create a zip archive of your configuration files!  
    *(Tip: you can use  
    `npx config-rocket zip -i=".roomodes"`  
    if you don't yet have a handy zipper.)*
* Users can now use the `roo-rocket` CLI to install your configurations.
