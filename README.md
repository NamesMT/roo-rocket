## Overview

***Roo Rocket**, the all-in-one equipment that you and Roo wants!"*

It's a one-for-all (meaning, usable in collaborated projects) config setup for that aims to provide the complete (opionated) setup for anyone to start using **`Roo Code`**.

For users:
  + Super easy to install, but super configurable, meaning all of these killer features are your choice:
    + Optimized Footgun (system prompt overrides)
    + Memory Banks
    + Smart Modes
    + *And more endlessly more!*

For trainers:
  + An elegant DX, fork, train your own version of Roo, create a GitHub release, and everyone can use it via `Roo Rocket` CLI!

## Rationale

`Roo Code` is shipping some amazing enhancements for customizations, and there's no good hub and base for Roo trainers yet, so, let's build one!

## Objectives

* [x] A pretty, **OPTIMIZED** image!
* [ ] Finish the initial repo layout
  * (library for the main dev env, cli app for setup).
* [ ] Setup development environment with amazing DX and power.
  * DRY: should have a system that allows general prompts to be defined and used across multiple modes, reducing duplication.
  * Configurable: Allowing for users to choose their own flavors of Rocket,
* [ ] Trainers branch with specialized codebase for Roo trainers
* [ ] Simple setup
  * Installing should be a breeze, simply execute a command, and `Roo Rocket` is ready to go, on any platform!
* [ ] Working base prompts
* [ ] Smart, optimized modes
* [ ] A webpage, featuring the community Roo trainers

## The expected user experience

On any platform: `Mac / Linux / Windows`, run a command:
```sh
npx roo-rocket --trainer="NamesMT"

# Interactively config your Roo

# Enjoy :)
```
