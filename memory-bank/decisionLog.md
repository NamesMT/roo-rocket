# Decision Log

This log records significant decisions made during the project lifecycle, including rationale and implications.

*   [2025-04-01 15:04:00] - Initialized Memory Bank structure based on automated project analysis. Decision was to split the analysis summary into standard Memory Bank files for better organization and ongoing context management.
*   [2025-04-08 08:18:42] - Project Initialization Decisions: Based on user input (`INIT_PROMPT.md` configuration), decided to:
    *   Rename project root to `roo-rocket--mono`.
    *   Remove both demo applications (`apps/frontend`, `apps/backend`).
    *   Remove SST configuration and related dependencies/files.
    *   Remove frontend-specific configurations (`uno.config.ts`, Vue ESLint rules, `@unocss/eslint-plugin`) as `TARGET_HAVE_FRONTEND` was false.
    *   Remove `locals/common-vue` as `FRONTEND_HAVE_VUE` was false.
    *   Update `README.md` and Memory Bank (`productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`) to reflect the new project name, description, and removed components.
    *   Remove initialization files (`INIT_PROMPT.md`, `INIT_PROMPT-EXAMPLES.md`).
*   [2025-04-08 08:22:19] - Post-Initialization Cleanup: Based on user feedback, decided to remove `locals/common` and `locals/locales` packages and update related configurations (`README.md`) and Memory Bank entries.
